# root

In the very root directory of the project there are following directories.

- .github
- .husky
- .next
- citrushack2023docs 
- components
- cypress
- lib
- node_modules
- [pages](pages)
- public
- styles
- types

A lot of the above directories are auto generated by the [`yarn create next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) command
