# `pages/`

# The `pages/` Folder in Next.js

The `pages/` folder is where you store the pages of your Next.js application. Each file in the `pages/` folder represents a route in your application, and is automatically associated with a corresponding URL based on the file name.

Here are some common types of files that you might find in the `pages/` folder:

- **JSX/TSX files:** Most pages in a Next.js application are defined using JSX files, which combine HTML-like syntax with JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. For example, you might create a `pages/index.js` file to define the home page of your application.

- **API routes:** In addition to pages, you can also define API routes in the `pages/` folder. API routes allow you to create server-side endpoints that can be accessed from client-side JavaScript code. For example, you might create a `pages/api/users.js` file to define an API route that retrieves a list of users from a database.

- **Dynamic routes:** Next.js supports dynamic routes, which allow you to create pages that use URL parameters to generate dynamic content. For example, you might create a `pages/posts/[slug].js` file to define a page that displays a specific blog post based on its slug.

- **Static files:** You can also store static files, such as images or CSS files, in the `public/` folder at the root of your project. These files can be accessed from any page in your application using a special URL path, such as `/static/image.png`.

By default, Next.js automatically generates an optimized build of your application that includes only the pages and components that are actually used by your application. This can improve performance and reduce the size of your application bundle.

Overall, the `pages/` folder is a key part of any Next.js application, as it defines the routes and content of your application. By organizing your pages and components carefully, you can create a clean and maintainable codebase that is easy to update and extend over time.
