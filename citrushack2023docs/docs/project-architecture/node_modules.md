# `node_modules/`

# The `node_modules/` Folder in Next.js

The `node_modules/` folder is where Node.js stores all the dependencies of your Next.js project. When you run `npm install` or `yarn install`, Node.js will download and install all the packages listed in your `package.json` file and their dependencies in the `node_modules/` folder.

Here are some common types of files and folders that you might find in the `node_modules/` folder:

- **Package folders:** Each package installed by Node.js will have its own folder in the `node_modules/` folder, with the name of the package. Inside each package folder, you will find the package's code, dependencies, and other metadata.

- **Package manifests:** Each package installed by Node.js will also have a `package.json` file that describes the package and its dependencies. This file contains information such as the package name, version, license, author, and dependencies.

- **Binary executables:** Some packages installed by Node.js may include binary executables that are used by your application. These executables may be located in the `node_modules/.bin/` folder, which is added to the `PATH` environment variable by Node.js.

- **Symlinks:** Node.js may create symlinks to the dependencies of your project in the `node_modules/` folder, rather than copying the entire dependency tree. This can save disk space and make it easier to manage large projects with many dependencies.

- **Cache folders:** Node.js may also create cache folders in the `node_modules/` folder to store downloaded packages and metadata. These cache folders can be useful for speeding up subsequent installations of the same packages.

Overall, the `node_modules/` folder is a crucial part of any Node.js or Next.js project, as it contains all the dependencies that your project relies on. It's important to keep the `node_modules/` folder up to date and manage its contents carefully, to ensure that your project runs smoothly and efficiently.
