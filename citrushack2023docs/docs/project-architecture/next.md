# `.next/`

# The `.next/` Folder in a Next.js Project

The `.next/` folder is a special folder that is automatically generated by Next.js when you build your application. It contains all of the compiled JavaScript and CSS assets, as well as other build artifacts that are used to serve your application.

Here are some of the key files and folders that you can find inside the `.next/` folder:

- `build-manifest.json`: A JSON file that contains information about the build process, including the paths of the compiled JavaScript and CSS assets.

- `cache/`: A folder that contains cached build artifacts that can be reused in subsequent builds to improve performance.

- `server/`: A folder that contains the compiled server-side code, including the code that handles server-side rendering and API endpoints.

- `static/`: A folder that contains any static assets, such as images or fonts, that are included in your application.

- `pages/`: A folder that contains the compiled JavaScript code for each of your application's pages, including the code that handles client-side rendering and navigation.

- `chunks/`: A folder that contains the compiled JavaScript code for each of the code splitting chunks that are used in your application.

Overall, the `.next/` folder is an important part of a Next.js project that contains all of the compiled assets and build artifacts that are used to serve your application. While you generally do not need to interact with this folder directly, understanding its contents can help you diagnose issues and optimize your application's performance.
