# `types/`

# The `types/` Folder in Next.js

The `types/` folder is where you can store TypeScript type definitions and interfaces in a Next.js project. This folder can be used to organize and manage your type definitions, and make it easier to maintain and reuse them across different parts of your application.

Here are some common types of files and folders that you might find in the `types/` folder:

- **Type definitions:** You can store TypeScript type definitions in the `types/` folder, such as types for API responses or data models. These types can then be imported into your TypeScript files using a special `import` statement, like `import { User } from '../types/User'`.

- **Interfaces:** You can also store TypeScript interfaces in the `types/` folder, which define the shape of objects and data structures used in your application. For example, you might create an `IPost` interface that describes the properties of a blog post.

- **Enums:** TypeScript enums can be used to define a set of named constants. You can store enums in the `types/` folder, and import them into your TypeScript files using a special `import` statement, like `import { UserRole } from '../types/UserRole'`.

By default, TypeScript is supported out of the box in Next.js, and you can use TypeScript with Next.js without any additional configuration. However, if you want to customize the TypeScript configuration of your Next.js project, you can create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project and specify custom configuration options.

Overall, the `types/` folder is a useful tool for managing and organizing your TypeScript code in a Next.js project. By carefully structuring your type definitions and interfaces, you can create a maintainable and reusable codebase that is easy to update and extend over time.
